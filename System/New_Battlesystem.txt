The character can move freely, there are no scene changes.

The battle is action based (there are no "rounds" etc.)

You can engage in close range battles with your normal weapon and you can attack from afar with the TRS-Weapon-Module.

You have to hit on beat to the music to deal full damage.

You won't get penalized if you don't attack on beat.

If you hit the enemy on beat several times, you enter Fever mode and deal even more damage.

You have 3 lives at the beginning and gain more by defeating bosses/minibosses
