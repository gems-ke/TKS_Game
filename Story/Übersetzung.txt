The future... Earth has changed... destroyed by the wars of the past.
Humans... aren't alone in the universe anymore. 
They have to share the earth with other races.
A new Beginning.
The highly intelligent robots who detached themselves from the humans.
Extraterrestrial colonists who have lost their homes.
The peace between the races is unstable.
(An artificial hybrid was created in secret. 
But he got out of control and fled the laboratory.)
It's only a matter of time before the bond between them breaks 
and all hopes of a strong alliance are crushed. 
A fated story unfolds under the stars...
